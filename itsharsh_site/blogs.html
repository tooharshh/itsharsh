    <h2>my first blog post</h2>
    <p class="post-date">july 30, 2025</p>
    
    <p>hey there! this is my first blog post on this site. i thought i'd share some thoughts about my journey in computer science and machine learning.</p>
    
    <p>currently, i'm working on llm post-training and machine translation. it's fascinating how these models can understand and generate human-like text. the field is evolving so rapidly that every day brings new discoveries.</p>
    
    <p>i also love teaching people about technology. there's something really rewarding about breaking down complex concepts into simple, understandable pieces.</p>
    
    <p>more blog posts coming soon...</p>
