    PAPERS SECTION - DATA-DRIVEN CONTENT WITH CARD LAYOUT
    
    This section dynamically generates paper cards from _data/papers.yml
    Changed from list-based to card-based layout for visual consistency with projects
    
    BENEFITS OF DATA FILES:
    - Add new papers by editing papers.yml (no HTML changes)
    - Consistent card formatting matching projects section
    - Easy to add metadata (year, status, citations, etc.)
    - Can filter by type, year, or status in future
    - Academic CV can be generated from same data
    
    DESIGN CONSISTENCY:
    - Uses same card structure as projects
    - Dotted borders and hover effects (defined in main.scss)
    - Visual hierarchy through typography and color
    - Professional academic presentation
    
    CARD STRUCTURE:
    - Paper title as main heading
    - Paper type and conference as metadata
    - Link to read the full paper
    - Optional status badge (published, under-review, etc.)
