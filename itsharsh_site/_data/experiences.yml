# EXPERIENCE DATA
# 
# This YAML file stores all professional experience entries
# Separating content from presentation improves maintainability
#
# WHY USE DATA FILES?
# 1. Easy content updates - change data without touching HTML
# 2. Consistent formatting - template ensures uniform display
# 3. Reusability - same data can be used in multiple places
# 4. Scalability - easy to add/remove/reorder entries
# 5. Version control friendly - cleaner diffs when content changes
#
# DATA STRUCTURE (ENHANCED FOR MULTIPLE ROLES):
# - organization: Company/organization name
#   start_date: Overall start date (earliest role)
#   end_date: Overall end date (latest role or "present")
#   roles: Array of positions within the organization
#     - title: Role title
#       start_date: Role start date
#       end_date: Role end date or "present"
#       description: Role-specific description
#
# SINGLE ROLE FORMAT (for organizations with one position):
# - organization: Company name
#   start_date: Start date
#   end_date: End date or "present"
#   role: Job title
#   description: Description
#
# USAGE IN TEMPLATES:
# {% for exp in site.data.experiences %}
#   {% if exp.roles %} (multiple roles)
#   {% else %} (single role)
# {% endfor %}
