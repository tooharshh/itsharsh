# EXPERIENCE DATA
# 
# This YAML file stores all professional experience entries
# Separating content from presentation improves maintainability
#
# WHY USE DATA FILES?
# 1. Easy content updates - change data without touching HTML
# 2. Consistent formatting - template ensures uniform display
# 3. Reusability - same data can be used in multiple places
# 4. Scalability - easy to add/remove/reorder entries
# 5. Version control friendly - cleaner diffs when content changes
#
