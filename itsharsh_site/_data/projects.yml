# PROJECTS DATA
#
# This YAML file stores all project entries
# Separating content from presentation improves maintainability
#
# WHY USE DATA FILES?
# 1. Easy to add new projects - just append to this file
# 2. Consistent formatting across all projects
# 3. Can easily filter/sort projects programmatically
# 4. Content is portable and can be reused elsewhere
# 5. Cleaner version control - content changes separate from layout changes
#
# DATA STRUCTURE:
# - title: Project name/title
#   url: Link to project (GitHub repo, live demo, or documentation)
#   description: Brief summary of what the project does
#   featured: (optional) true/false - for highlighting important projects
#
# USAGE IN TEMPLATES:
# {% for project in site.data.projects %}
#   <h3><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.title }}</a></h3>
#   <p>{{ project.description }}</p>
# {% endfor %}
