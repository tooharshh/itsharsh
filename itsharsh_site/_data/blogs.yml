# BLOG LINKS DATA
#
# This YAML file stores links to blog posts hosted on Notion
# Separating content links from presentation improves maintainability
#
# WHY USE DATA FILES FOR EXTERNAL LINKS?
# 1. Easy to add new blog posts - just append to this file
# 2. Consistent card formatting across all blog links
# 3. Can add metadata like date, tags, featured status
# 4. Content is portable and can be reused elsewhere
# 5. Keeps the blogs.html template clean and focused on presentation
#
# DATA STRUCTURE:
# - title: Blog post title
#   url: Link to Notion page (or other external host)
#   date: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format for sorting)
#   description: Brief summary of the post content
#   tags: (optional) Array of topic tags for categorization
#   featured: (optional) true/false - highlight important posts
#
# USAGE IN TEMPLATES:
# {% for blog in site.data.blogs %}
#   <h3><a href="{{ blog.url }}">{{ blog.title }}</a></h3>
#   <p>{{ blog.description }}</p>
# {% endfor %}
