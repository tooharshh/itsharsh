## hey there

welcome to the blog section of this site. finally got around to setting this up properly with jekyll and all the seo goodness.

### what to expect

this blog will probably cover:

- **ai/ml stuff** - experiments, learnings, failures (lots of those)
- **tech thoughts** - random observations about the industry
- **project updates** - what i'm building and why it's (probably) breaking
- **earthquake early warning** - my main research focus
- **random musings** - because why not

### why lowercase?

you might notice everything's in lowercase. not a typo, just a vibe. keeps things casual and less formal. we're all just trying to figure stuff out anyway.

### the technical bits

this blog is built with:
- **jekyll** - static site generator (fast and simple)
- **markdown** - writing format (readable and portable)
- **custom layouts** - consistent with the rest of the site
- **seo optimization** - because being found matters
- **dark mode** - your eyes will thank me

### what's next

planning to write about:
1. ai for earthquake prediction (my current obsession)
2. building foresight-x from scratch
3. lessons from nexttechlab
4. why digital twins are cooler than you think

## subscribe (eventually)

rss feed is available at [/feed.xml]({{ '/feed.xml' | relative_url }}). no email newsletters because i respect your inbox.
